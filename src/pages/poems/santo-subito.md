_See there!  
See what one man can do  
when he walks with God!  
See the many faithful  
Heâ€™s inspired!_

_They come to honor him,  
The millions for this one humble man.  
The common, the famous,  
The wealthy, the poor,  
The young and the old,  
From every faith, every race and creed,  
They cry, they celebrate,  
They clap for this one mortal man._

_They remember his love for them,  
His teachings of peace,  
Of forgiveness,  
Of suffering and dying._

_A world mourns and rejoices;  
They honor this one holy man,  
For his close walk with Christ,  
For this life well lived._

_See what one man can do!_

_Santo Subito!_
