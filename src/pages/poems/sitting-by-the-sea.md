_Sitting there by the sea,  
Wishing for what could not be.  
Three at peace,  
Unspeakable grief.  
Lives well tended,  
Futures ended._

_A favorite son,  
With all gifts but one.  
A beloved wife,  
His shining light.  
A sister much loved,  
Joins them in heaven above._

_Sorrow’s bitter tears shed,  
Loving eulogies said.  
History’s pages turned,  
Lessons again to be learned.  
A nation weeps,  
With only memories to keep._

_Sitting here by the sea,  
Wishing for what could not be  
Three at peace,  
Unspeakable grief._
