It fell to the Earth  
Without a single cry.  
What once twinkled bright  
In the Midnight’s sky  
Fell to the cold dark Earth  
To smolder and die.

Never looking back  
To the others set afire;  
Never to be returned  
To its companion balls of fire  
In the Midnight’s black.  
It simply smoldered and died.
