title: Make Way!

---
Spring hesitantly creeps forward today  
Nudging unwilling Winter on his way.  
Trees bud in her teasing warm breezes  
Cast between Winterâ€™s half-hearted sieges.

Flowers coaxed by her gentle bidding  
Awaken and rise from where once hidden.  
Birdsong melody once again fills the air  
In joyous symphony of spring time prayer.

So hurry on your way, dreary cold Winter  
Go, and take with you your arctic glitter!  
Spring has come to settle and stay;  
Make way, I say, make way!
