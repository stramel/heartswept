I’m suddenly aware of  
How similar my life journey is  
To something taught to me  
Years ago by a wise woman,  
My mother.

  
I am reminded how my life  
Lies safely in the Hands  
Of He who knows the beginning  
And the end.  
Of His folding the thin gossamer  
Containing my whole life.  
With a first simple fold  
Of one corner to another,  
And with each crease following  
A little more complex  
And little more intrinsic.  
Each fold made precisely  
With loving care,  
The desired end in mind,  
Until the final fold reveals  
My own sacred flight  
Crafted by His Hands.

  
So I have begun the ancient art  
Of folding again,  
The one taught to me by  
My mother.  
This time I fold them for her…  
A thousand cranes  
Each carrying their own prayer  
To take flight with her  
In the end.
