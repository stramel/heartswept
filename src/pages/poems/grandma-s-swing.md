(In memory of Grandma Carrie)

Grandma’d tell me of days gone by  
In the shade of a hot summer day  
We’d softly swing back and forth  
Keeping time at a slower pace.  
Life was much simpler then  
On Grandma’s front porch swing.

Swinging in comfortable unison,  
I’d share with her my stories,  
Of school days and best friends.  
We’d wave to passing neighbors  
While watching the world go by  
From Grandma’s front porch swing.

On holidays when family gathered  
My cousins and I rushed to find  
Cherished privacy on the favored swing.  
We’d talk of teenage loves;  
We’d laugh, whisper, and dream  
On Grandma’s front porch swing.

Nine years have passed us by  
Since Grandma was laid to rest.  
Her house belongs to someone new  
And I find I long once more  
For Grandma’s front porch swing.

Life was so much simpler then  
On Grandma’s front porch swing.
