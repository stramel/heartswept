I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
With the Master by my side  
I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
In the promised eternal life

I hear my Master calling  
From that cross upon the hill  
And I know I am forgiven  
Though over sin I stumble still.

I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
With the Master by my side  
I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
In the promised eternal life.

I want to hear the choirs of angels  
Lift up their glorious song  
And to dance with saints and believers  
And know I truly belong.

I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
With the Master by my side  
I want to walk the streets of Heaven  
In the promised eternal life.
