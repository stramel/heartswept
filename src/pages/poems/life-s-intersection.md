Sitting on the curb  
In front of the 7-11,  
Yellowed white hair  
And Santa Claus beard.  
Wise azure eyes,  
Whose gaze takes in every detail,  
Set in a deeply wrinkled face.  
Smoking a cigar  
While watching the trucks go by.  
Brown-banded watch keeping the time  
While feet clad in brown work boots  
Placidly wait.  
Belongings packed in a trash bag  
And an old duffel bag.  
Worn green baseball cap  
Resting upon his head,  
Shading those alert azure eyes  
Watching as life passes him by.  
Waiting for something  
Or someone unknown.
