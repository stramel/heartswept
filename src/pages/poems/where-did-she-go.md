title: Where Did She Go?

---
Where did she go,  
This woman I know?  
The grower of flowers,  
Her favorite the rose.  
The football fan  
Cheering on her team.  
The avid reader  
Who shared her books  
With me.

She lives in the past  
Where her memories don’t last  
She doesn’t know who to trust  
She’s forgotten all of us.  
She lives in the past with glimpses of now.  
I wish I could bring her back to stay somehow.  
I wish I could bring her back to now.

Where did she go,  
This woman I know?  
Quick with numbers  
Done in her head  
The fashion designer  
Of her own clothes  
The fixer of things  
Like toasters that burn  
And mixers not spinning.

She lives in the past  
Where her memories don’t last  
She doesn’t know who to trust  
She’s forgotten all of us.  
She lives in the past with glimpses of now.  
I wish I could bring her back to stay somehow.  
I wish I could bring her back to now.

Where did she go?  
This mother I know  
The supplier of hugs  
And plenty of smiles.  
The master penny pincher,  
Who did without  
So we could have,  
Who taught us to honor our dad.  
She’d never leave on her own.

She lives in the past  
Where her memories don’t last  
She doesn’t know who to trust  
She’s forgotten all of us.  
She lives in the past with glimpses of now.  
I wish I could bring her back to stay somehow.  
I wish I could bring her back to now.
