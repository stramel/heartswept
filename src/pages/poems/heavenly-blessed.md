Child of my earthly flesh  
You are forever blessed  
With God’s loving Grace  
Shining upon your trusting face.  
Through His eyes you see  
With a vision of pure clarity,  
A vision born of innocence  
And uncolored by human pretense.

Your simple wisdom does us humble  
Though over broken words you stumble.  
Your simple joy and laughter ring  
With the love of which angels sing.  
God’s pure and unconditional love shown;  
Through you His lessons have flown!  
What on Earth may seem unfair and less  
In His wisdom is heavenly blessed.
