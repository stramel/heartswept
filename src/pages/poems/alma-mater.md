Lonely and abandoned  
Still upon its slope  
Barren of trees  
Empty parking lot.  
Begs for a return of life  
A return of  
Young voices calling  
Laughter flowing down its halls.  
The bang of locker doors  
Shuffling of papers  
Whispering in classes  
Period bells.  
Basketballs dribbling  
Cheering and bands  
Footsteps running  
Up and down the stairs  
The tap tap of typing  
The drone of lessons  
Being taught and learned.  
  
The field to the left  
Track barely showing  
Goal posts still guarding  
The field missing its glory,  
Missing the excitement.  
Missing the football games  
With lights highlighting  
Every play called  
Every whistle blown  
The cheering crowd  
Supporting their favorite sons  
Missing Homecoming  
With its festive crowd  
Welcoming the candidates  
Crowning of royalty.  
The track missing  
Young feet pounding  
Their urgent rhythm  
The firing of the starting gun  
The passing of batons.  
The air holding the leaps  
The sand caressing the landing.  
  
Viewing this place  
With childhood memories still fresh.  
With three decades of western winds  
blown past.  
I see what is and miss what  
Resides in the memory  
Of once a child.
