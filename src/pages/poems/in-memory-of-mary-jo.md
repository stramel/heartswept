Wistfully  
trailing smoke has vanished;  
the essence of  
its scent is  
but a hint now.  
The once entrancing  
dancing flame is  
extinguished.  
All its warmth receded;  
its molten journeys hardened.  
Leaving a fragile charred wick  
in vague evidence to the  
flickering graceful dance  
once made.  
Oh, but to see  
your glowing pirouette  
just one time more.  
Somedayâ€¦  
Someday.
