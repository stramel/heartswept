Divinely conceived  
To fit right there  
So small  
Yet so large,  
So delicate  
Yet so strong.

Strong enough  
**To channel the lifeblood,**  
To last a lifetime  
Of triumph and tragedy.

Large enough  
To hold the love  
Of beloved family,  
cherished friends,  
And nameless strangers  
Of a perplexing world.

Delicate enough  
To cradle the infinite,  
The fragile frame  
Of the singular soul.

Small enough  
To wrap snugly  
The boundless expanse  
Of a whole universe  
Warmly within.

And I am lucky  
You share it with me.
