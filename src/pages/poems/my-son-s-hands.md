_When did your hands_  
_Become a man’s?_  
_When did those sweet little boy hands,_  
_Those hands that fit so perfectly in mine,_  
_The trusting ones that held mine tight_  
_As we started each new day’s adventure,_  
_When did they become a man’s?_

_Now mine fit in yours_  
_In a strange yet familiar grasp,_  
_One ready and confident_  
_To meet new adventures,_  
_To embrace the future,_  
_To let go and explore on their own._

_I miss the days of little boy hands_  
_While clasping the hand of a young man,_  
_Remembering the sweet trust and love_  
_Held in little boy hands._
