In a barren plowed field it stood,  
A lonely sentinel of weathered wood.  
Standing in silent witness of bygone days  
To all who hurriedly passed its way.

Once alive with a familyâ€™s busy bustling  
And soothed by cottonwood leaves rustling,  
It stood quietly empty and starkly unshaded,  
A beckoning monument to memories now faded.
