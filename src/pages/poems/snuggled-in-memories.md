title: Snuggled In Memories

As I lie there all snuggled in my covers, ready for rest  
To the left lie my beautiful stars, every night,  
Always true, always there  
To the right sits a wonderful mother,  
The mother I so dearly know and love  
As she sits there softly, reading those words to me,  
I gaze off into the stars, lost in their bright wonder  
Flowing into me the greatest childhood memories.
