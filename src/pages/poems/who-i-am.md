Who I Am

I am who I am.  
I am the vessel  
Made of the earth  
And to the earth I will return.  
I am the soul within  
Awaiting my journey’s end  
And the start of life again.

I was born of all who came before me  
And shaped by those surrounding me.  
I am the child who once was  
And the woman who is now.

A thousand hands have molded me;  
A thousand hearts guide me.  
Countless souls I visit  
On my passage through time.

I am the culmination  
Of my life’s joys and sorrows.  
I am the sum of all of these.  
I am their total.  
I am who I am.
